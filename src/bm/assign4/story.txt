A young man asked Socrates the secret of success. Socrates told the young man to meet him near
the river the next morning. They met. Socrates asked the young man to walk with him into the
river. When the water got up to their neck, Socrates took the young man by surprise and swiftly
ducked him into the water.
The boy struggled to get out but Socrates was strong and kept him there until the boy started
turning blue. Socrates pulled the boy’s head out of the water and the first thing the young man
did was to gasp and take a deep breath of air.
Socrates asked him, "what did you want the most when you were there?" The boy replied, "Air".
Socrates said, "That is the secret of success! When you want success as badly as you wanted the
air, then you will get it!" There is no other secret.
